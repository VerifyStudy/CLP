             CLP PUBLIC LICENCE 
             Version 1,2020-2021

                  Preamble
    The licenses for most software are designed 
    to take away your freedom to share and change 
    it.Our General Public Licenses are designed 
    to make sure that you have the freedom to 
    distribute copies of free software.

    We protect your rights with two steps: 
    (1) copyright the software;
    (2) offer you this license which gives you legal
     permission to copy,distribute and/or modify the 
     software.

    Also, for each author's protection and ours, we
    want to make certain that everyone understands 
    that there is no warranty for this free software.
    If the software is modified by someone else and 
    passed on, we want its recipients to know that 
    what they have is not the original, so that any 
    problems introduced by others will not reflect 
    on the original authors' reputations.

    Finally, any free program is threatened constantly 
    by softwarepatents.  We wish to avoid the danger 
    that redistributors of a free program will individually 
    obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program 
    proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear 
    that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free 
    use or not licensed at all.
